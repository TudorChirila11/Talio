### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback:
- Your submission meets the requirements

### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: 
- The structure is good, it includes a list of stakeholders, terms of the domain, user stories and also mockups
- Most content is detailed and clear
- Maybe move the mockup section to the end of the document, to facilitate the reading


### Epics

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback:
- You should organise your backlog in epics (see assignment description for more info on epics) which represent the main features.
- The epics should be prioritized and the indepenent user stories that constitue that feature to follow a prioritization too. If there is a story A and a story B dependant on A, A should go first.
- You identified a good prioritization already with must/should/could, make sure you keep the idea when you convert to epics and clearly mention what is the "minimal app" epic
- Your mockups are good and complement the features.
- Are you sure admin functionality is needed? Some of them seem to be implementation choices or non-functional requirements.

### User Stories

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback:
- Your user stories follow the required format and have a clear focus from user perspective, good job.
- Most of them contain 1 workflow, make sure you identify the ones that can be still broken into smaller user stories
- Some use terms that are not that clear, make sure you add them in the terms section (e.g. drag and drop)
- Some user stories seem to overlap between user and admin. Try to identify which stakeholder actually wants a feature and remove duplicates/overalps.
- Most of your user stories are coherent and cover the requirements from lectures.


### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Good

Feedback:
- Since you follow the format and most of the user stories are small, their effect is clear and you can identify the acceptance criteria.
- Most of user stories are formulated in a measurable way and remove redundant/useless information. The more concise the more clear it is to define a user story as "finished".
