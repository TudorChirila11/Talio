- There are some parts that could be a little more descriptive or cover more aspects.


### Assignment Description

### Products

Mark: Good

Feedback:
- The coding product is described nicely, with enough details

Feedback:
- You nicely set agreements for ensuring team work and for who is responsible of handing in the assignments
- You reflected the deadlines in a organized form and mentioned how you assign tasks
- The work for this rubric is very nice, the only thing you could think about is using gitlab instead of your google docs. There exists features in gitlab that are actually made for what you were trying to achieve with docs.


### Communication

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- You have a simple plan for which channels to use for which information.
- Maybe you could also think how you communicate to make decision about meetings.

### Commitment

Mark: Excellent

Feedback:
- Your agreements for chair/minute taker are very nice and clear
- You also go in detail for how to convey the quality of group work and individual, mentioning how you measure the quality of it.
- We even discussed this prior and I am very happy about how this part end up

### Division of Tasks and Roles
  
Mark: Sufficient

Feedback:
- You setted on how to assign the chairs/ minute takers, but you stoped here.
- Try to also think about other division of roles/tasks. It could be nice to incorporate what you described in the planning part. Maybe think how you actually will distribute those tasks you want to keep track of. Will there be a meeting? Do you have other strategies?


### Meetings
  
Mark: Good

Feedback: 
- You made agreements on how often to meet and when next to the TA meetings.
- You could also think on what you plan to achieve in the non-TA meetings? How will you conduct them?

### Decision Making 
  
Mark: Good

Feedback:
- You made clear agreements on how to make decisions and how to deal with the case in which someone won't agree
- Maybe think about the expectation of that case? What kind of help you want from the TA?

### Dealing with Conflicts
  
Mark: Good

Feedback:
- You made clear agreements on how to deal with conflicts and when to involve the TA in case something is escaladating.
- Again, think about the expectation of that case? What kind of help you want from the TA?

### Guidance
  
Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
- You are very clear on your expectations on guidance and elaborate nicely for each case.
- We also talked about it a little, but we did not discussed together about all cases.


### Consequences
  
Mark: Sufficient

Feedback:
- You stated clear general consequences but did not think of different types of consequences for different problems. Maybe you could think of behaviour consequences not just task related?


### Success Factors
  
Mark: Good

Feedback:
- You have some nice success factor, some of them seem general but the comfortable and inviting atmosphere is a very personal one.

### Norms or Evaluation Criteria
  
Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- The norms and evaluation criteria chosen are reasonable but not all so measurable. 
- You could also think why you chose these specfic ones and how you actully know when work met the criteria.
