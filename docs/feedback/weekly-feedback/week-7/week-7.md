#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback:

- You presented a demo, with some progress (websockets) since last time, but still with bugs. Make sure you improve in reviewing, so that you can avoid having faulty code on main which might hurt the demo video. You have a lot of work in progress, but based on what is on main, you may pass with the basic features. If you aim for a higher grade, you should step up a little.
