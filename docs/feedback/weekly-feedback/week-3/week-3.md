# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization


Chair: Teun den Boer
Minute taker: Tudor Chirila

Mark: Pass

Feedback:
-The meeting had a chair + minute taker and had a good organization overall


#### Agenda 

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: 
- The agendas are still not commited in the right directory on gitlab. Please act on this quick.
- They seemed to follow the template and had clear points, but I remembered that a lot of changes occured during the meeting.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Feedback:

- I provided feedback for this last time. From now the minute taker will recieve feedback as stated. The next week feedback will include the minute taker from this week.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback:
- The performance overall was good, but can be improved.
- I really liked the opening, because the chair setted the tone and the purpose very nicely.
- It was lacking the attention on the time, since some discussion went on too much. As a tip try to keep an eye on it to ensure you have time to follow all agenda points. I still appreciated that you took my comments into consideration when I asked to move on because of time limits.
- Even if the chair needed to be reminded of the closing, it was pretty well made. I recommend making a to do list with the steps of a chair. You can always keep an eye of them during the meeting in case you forget something.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback:
- The team took the ownership of the meeting, but still needed my intervensions sometimes. It felt like you were not that prepared for the meeting or how you wanted to order tasks.
- Everybody was very active and cooperant
- You are very receptive to feedback and in general listen to each other opinions, good job. You seem to have a nice relation among the group.
- As a tip, to ensure the meeting is as productive as possible, make sure you always go back to the feedback before the meeting, it can change the focus/ plans.


#### Potentially Shippable Product
Mark: Insufficient

Feedback:
- There was no potentially shippable application yet.
- I started the conversation on coding this time, please make sure you start assigning tasks and make progress in the code part until next meeting.
