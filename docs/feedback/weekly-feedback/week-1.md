#### 1) Self-organization

Sufficient - You tried to moderate the meeting after the intro round and self-organized on the code of conduct, platforms etc.
As a tip, you could try to involve everybody more in the meeting. Some people were a little quite. Also, try to keep the meetings on the point, sometimes you tend to defocus. 


#### 2) Suggested Topics

Good - You covered the suggested topics very good. Keep up using the guidance from the teamwork to improve your meetings. You should have an agenda setting up the focus points of the meetings, including your questions and the topics from lectures.
