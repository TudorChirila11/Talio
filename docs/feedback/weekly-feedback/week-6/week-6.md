#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Alexandru

Minute taker: Sagar

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The meeting had a minute taker and a chair.


#### Agenda 


Mark: Good

Feedback: 
- As a **TIP** you could add more small points per part, It can be easier to follow and make sure you did not forget anything for a specific point. Since our meeting usually start with a lot of questions, maybe it will be nice to share the agenda with the team and let them add their questions in a section. This way I can also prepare more answers. 
- As a **TOP** the agenda follows the template. It was on time on gitlab and follows all my advice on adding the short checkup round and demo.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker


Mark: Good

Feedback:
- **TOP** the note taker did a good job, it seems that all important info is there, in an understandable format.
- As a **TIP** I recommend using bullet points and sub points (list format) to make the text more readable. You can also use tables for the points of action to also assign the tasks and put deadlines for this parts, this way it is more clear what are normal notes and the points of actions.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback:
- As a **TOP** the chair was following the agenda, ensuring everything is ticked. Moreover, the time spent on each topic was appropriate, following the planning of the agenda. He included everybody and constantly asked people for questions. He also interviened when people were changing discussion or not following the topic. Very good job. Also very nice closing.
- As a **TIP** try for next time to do a small conclusion after every point with the agreements. I said last time that this way you can help the notetaker to focus on the discussion and write the notes at the end of the topic. 
- As another **TIP**, do not forget the opening, even if you are running out on time, it helps me to keep track of how is the chair/minute taker.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback:
- As a **TOP**, you are becoming better and better at taking the ownership of the meeting. I have very few moments when I need to intervene. The atmosphere is very constructive and you decided on good points. You also appreciate everybody's opinions.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback:
- As a **TOP**, this time you had a demo which showed some good progress. I can see that most of the first epic is completed (or worked on). This pace is a good start, but make sure you speed up a little in order to be fully on track. (**TIP**)
