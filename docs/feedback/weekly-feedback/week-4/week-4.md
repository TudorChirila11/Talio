# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization


Chair: Tudor

Minute taker: Teun

Mark: **Pass**

Feedback:
- The meeting had a chair + minute taker and had a good organization overall.


#### Agenda 

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: 
- The agenda is commited in time and was organized very nice.
- As a **TOP** I also liked the sub-points organization.
- As a **TIP** please incorporate an item called **Demo** when we actually go over the code and you present the features on one computer from main branch. Also make sure we have a small intro where you can tell what task each of you worked on. It could also be a good idea to add some questions in advance to the questions part.
- Another minor thing, our slot is from 15:45 - 16:30. The agenda this week was going over time.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: **Insufficient**

Feedback:
- The notes are were not submitted at all yet.
- As a **TIP** maybe extend the notes that are very minimal. You could try to make sure they are still very descriptive even if you read them 2 weeks after, when you are not having the meeting fresh in mind. (here i only have suggestions without actually seeing your minutes)


#### Chair performance

Mark: **Good**

Feedback:
- The performance overall was good, it was organized, and followed the agenda.
- As a **TOP** the chair was moderating very good. He always ask for opinion and started discussions. I liked the summary as well.
- As a **TIP** try to address the people that are not that involved, for example the note taker is usally quiet. To help with this issue, I recommend after every point make a small summary so the notetaker can be part of the discussion and also have time for the minutes. Also I recognised that some people are usually more quiet. Please help them to talk more. Also make sure when closing the meeting that everything is clear for the members. 
- As another **TIP**, you were running out of time on some parts. Please keep the time in mind or assign more time for some disucussions in this case the sprint planning. In this case you will not have to rush in other parts.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: **Good**

Feedback:
- The team took the ownership of the meeting, and organized.
- Everybody was mostly active and cooperant most of the time.
- You are very receptive to feedback and in general listen to each other opinions, good job. Most of to have a nice relation among the group.
- As a **Tip** I still feel that the sprint planning and assigning of tasks took too long, making the meeting not that productive. Maybe try to do that in your own meeting beforehand.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: **Sufficient**

Feedback:
- There was a potentially shippable application, with some progress. Keep that up to be on track.
- Try from now on to come with 1 laptop for the demo and just have a brief intro on who implemented which task. You did not made points in the agenda about this, thus we went over time.
- Please make sure you also incorporate the feedback on code contribution (you will recieve this by this week coresponding to the progress in week 3).
- As a **TOP** I appreciate that you made a sprint planning, this is a good indicator you will start working organized. Maybe it could still be more efficient to do this in a separate meeting from now, so we have time to go through the actual progress and assignments in the meeting.
